Name: PFT Chef Server for Linux (RightLink 10)
Description: |
  Chef Server for Linux (RightLink 10) ServerTemplate will install and configure a standalone Chef Server. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to install.
  _It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 series._
  See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html) for details.

  This Chef Server ST runs a script to update the packaging system and enable automatic security updates, and a collectd install script to enable RightScale monitoring.See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html) for details.

  Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs instance stranded
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
  Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs cpu overloaded
  Description: Raise an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 3 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu I/O wait
  Description: Raise an alert if disk io is too high.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-wait.value > 40 for 15 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs low space in root partition

  Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data transmitted is too high.
    This alert may be modified or cloned on an instance to match the actual network
    interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh)
    for more details.
