  See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html) for details.

  This Chef Server ST runs a script to update the packaging system and enable automatic security updates, and a collectd install script to enable RightScale monitoring.See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html) for details.

  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
