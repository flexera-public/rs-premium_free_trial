Name: PFT Database Manager for MySQL for Chef Server (RightLink 10)
Description: "Database Manager for MySQL 5.1/5.5 ServerTemplate for RightLink10 and
  a Chef Server.   RightLink10 is a new agent to connect servers to the RightScale
  platform that is very lightweight and simple to install.\r\n_It is not a plug-in
  upgrade from the older RightLink v6 series._\r\nSee [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.\r\n\r\nThis ServerTemplate provides a high-availability master/slave
  MySQL database configuration that can be used as the backbone for a variety of applications
  and workloads. The MySQL version installed depends on the default package available
  for the OS. CentOS 6.5 installs MySQL 5.1, and Ubuntu 12.04 installs MySQL 5.5.\r\n\r\n__
